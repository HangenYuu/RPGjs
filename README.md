A simple RPG game to kill time. To start, clone the repo locally. Then click on the HTML file, which will automatically open in browser. Alternative, you can use Live Server extension of VSCode (how to use it is left for the user to figure out). Enjoy.

The only and original version is [here](https://replit.com/@BeauCarnes/JavaScript-RPG).
